# Expense Tracker Application

I've created very simple and useful Expense Tracking Application.

### Outline:
- User can add Income and Expenses both 
- Net Amount will be calculated automatically (Income - expenses)
- Once user cross the income Amount, Net Amount will become red to alert the user for extra expenses
- User can edit or delete existing expenses

### Screens UI:
